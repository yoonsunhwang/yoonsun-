    <h1>First Internet Memory</h1>
    <h2>by Yoonsun</h2>
    <p>I probably started playing dressing up on my family computer.<br>I really enjoyed playing games and then I moved on to <em>Youtube</em> to watch music videos pretty much.<br>I remember watching <strong>ShiNee, Girls Generation</strong> and <strong>Big Bang</strong> and I was in <span style="color: darkred;">love</span>. It's crazy to think that this generation was born with iPads. I remember watching the thick TV in my parents study room with the computer and handling the computer seemed so difficult.<br>I was very wowed by my mum navigating through <strong>NAVER</strong>. On this page there were so so so many options. I think later on I made my email to penpal my friends living in UK.<br>Then soon after I made my own cyworld diary. This was almost like <em>Instagram</em>, <em>Facebook</em> and <em>Snapchat</em> together. Everything was on there. My blog, my avatar, my diary, my schedule. You'd have to request each other to make friends and read the contents and comment. But you could also post thing <strong>public</strong> which I personally never did. I believe some people actually got scouted & discovered to be singers and actors which was a big deal. In a way this must have been like the <strong>explore page</strong> of <em>Instagram</em>.<br>Honestly though, I do miss the simpler versions. It does feel quite crude but it had its own aesthetic and not much pressure to make everything so nice. In a way the messyness added to it. <strong>Grunge</strong>, is that what they say? and <strong>indiesleaze</strong>. I love the outfits and I think it's fun to play around with my old ipod. Bring it back! But maybe it's fun because I have a crippling individuality complex and it's just not a mainstream thing right now?<br>Food for thought...</p>
